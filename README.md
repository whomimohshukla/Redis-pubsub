# Redis WebSocket Pub/Sub System 🔴🌐

This repository is my hands-on implementation of Redis, WebSockets, and Pub/Sub architecture based on the **"Complete Redis, WebSockets, Pub/Sub & Messaging"** 

---

## 📌 What I Learned

This project helped me understand and implement:

- 🔁 **Redis Pub/Sub** model — how channels work between publishers and subscribers
- 🌐 **WebSocket server** — creating real-time communication between frontend and backend
- 🔧 **Connecting Redis with WebSocket** — to handle and broadcast messages
- ⚙️ **Scalable system architecture** — building a base for real-time chat/message apps

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time communication using WebSockets
- Redis for fast in-memory pub/sub messaging
- Publisher sends messages to Redis → subscribers (WebSocket clients) receive them instantly
- Simple client-server setup
